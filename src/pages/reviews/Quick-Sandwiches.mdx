Ordered: Roast Chicken Sandwich <br/>
Cost: $13.99

This place essentially feels like a locally-owned version of Subway with healthier, higher-quality ingredients. Paying $14 before tax and tip for a sandwich with no sides
or drink didn't feel particularly good, so this restaurant doesn't get a particularly high rating on price. The sandwich itself was reasonably large and fairly
filling, but I will definitely have to go back again and order something else with my sandwich to have the full experience. The atmosphere was quite relaxing and
the place felt clean and comfortable, but I would have to come back and eat in next time --- so the 7.0 rating is sort of a placeholder.
