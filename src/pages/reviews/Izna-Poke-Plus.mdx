Ordered: Salmon Poké Bowl <br/>
Cost: $15.99

The first thing to note about this place is the price. For the amount and quality of the food you receive here, $15.99 is fantastic. The portions are quite large and
extremely filling. The ingredients were all fresh and tasted fantastic. I have eaten my share of raw fish before, and it can sometimes have an offputting texture
and a taste that shows that it is not fresh or well-stored. The raw salmon in my poké bowl had no such issues. The texture was pleasant, with no chewiness or sliminess,
and there was no "fishy" or off taste. Besides that, their sauces (of which I had the house-made specialty soy sauce and the sesame sauce) were delicious, and added a
lot to the meal.

The service and food prep were very fast, and the cashier (who also prepped my food) was quiet but friendly and provided great service. The atmosphere is pleasant
but it is still clearly a fast food place. It is fairly small and somewhat noisy due to the fact that they share a unit with a boba place, The Alley, and there is only
a partial wall between the two. Again this is somewhere you could have a quick meal on *part* of a date, but the atmosphere is not quite there for an evening out. 
That's perfectly okay, but still pulls down the rating a couple of points.

Overall, Izna Poké Plus on University Avenue is a pleasant and reasonably priced spot to get a healthy and filling meal with very little wait.
