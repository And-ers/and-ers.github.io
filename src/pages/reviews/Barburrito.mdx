Let me start by saying these were some of the best restaurant street tacos I've had, which come to think of it, is more of an indictment of the Mexican restaurants I had
access to in St. John's than a true commendment of barBURRITO. The food was decent, but obviously nothing too special --- they were cheap fast food tacos, after all.
The prices were surprisingly fair, and the service was fantastic. The two workers apologized for my wait, even though I had only been in the building for about 7 minutes,
not particularly long considering I had about 5 people ahead of me who ordered quite a lot of food. The three of us had a lovely conversation that began with me apologizing
for lining up at the wrong end of the counter (my bad).

Unfortunately the reason this rating isn't higher is simply because of the atmosphere. There are places to sit, but it's a tight and not particularly comfortable location
with a lot of noise and a lot of traffic (both foot traffic and actual cars) outside. Not really a place you'd want to take a date. In fact, I didn't even really want to
eat there myself, instead opting to eat my tacos in the car.

To summarize, barBURRITO is really just a fast food place with pretty good street tacos to grab when you're in a hurry or have plans to eat somewhere else --- and that's
okay. It just means it isn't quite impressive enough to rank higher.
