Ordered: Turkey cranberry brie sandwich, large iced sugar free vanilla latte, and a cherry greek yogurt danish. <br/>
Cost: $23.20

Obviously, I was genuinely very impressed with this place. So much so that it's the only place I've already revisited before writing the review. The first thing to
mention is that the espresso is quite nice. My iced latte was just strong enough that the flavour of the espresso really came through, but not so strong that it
was off-putting. The fact that they had sugar free vanilla syrup was also quite nice, but I would have really appreciated other sugar-free options.
