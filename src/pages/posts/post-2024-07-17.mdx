# What is a prime number?

Let $n$ be a positive, whole number. Remember that a *factor* of $n$ is a whole number that divides $n$; so if we call the factor $d$, this means that $\dfrac{n}{d}$ is 
a whole number. Briefly, a prime number is a number that has exactly two factors (1 and $n$).

<Aside>
    Importantly, note that this definition means 1 is *not* a prime number since it only has a single factor: 1. This is on purpose! Why do we define it this way?
    You may have heard about the "fundamental theorem of arithmetic" --- just maybe not by name. Given any whole number, we can find its **prime factorization**,
    i.e. we write the number as a product of prime numbers. For example:
    $$ 280 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 2^3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7. $$
